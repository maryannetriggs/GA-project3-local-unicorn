# GA Project 3 - Local Unicorn

Local Unicorn is a travel website to help travellers find unique tours provided by local guides (unicorns). Users can either register as a traveller and book tours or as a unicorn and provide tours. This was the third project I completed during the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive (bootcamp) course.

## Getting Started

Use the clone button to download the source code. In your terminal enter the following commands:

### To install all the packages listed in the package.json:
$ yarn

### Run the app on your localhost:
$ yarn start

## To Use

There are many ways to navigate around the website to find your ideal tour. On the homepage you can begin searching by either chosing a city from a pre-defined list or chose to view all the available cities.

If you view all available cities you see the following

![readme-three](images/readme/cities-overview.png)

Any of the cities can be selected and user is taken to a show page for that city complete with a beautiful panoramic photograph and a paragraph giving a short introduction. From this page, users can chose to see the local guides (unicorns) in that city or go back a page to view all the cities again.

Unicorns are displayed in 'cards' with profile pictures, names, languages spoken and experiences offered. Unicorns can be filtered by gender and language spoken. If no unicorns match the required filter options an 'empty state' message is displayed.

Once a unicorn is selected, users are shown a profile of the unicorn and also the experiences they offer in 'cards'

![readme-six](images/readme/unicorn-profile.png)
![readme-seven](images/readme/unicorn-experiences.png)

Any of the experiences/tours can be selected and user is taken to a show page for that experience complete with a beautiful panoramic photograph, experience info (experience category, intensity, cost and availability) and a paragraph giving a short introduction. From this page, users can chose to book the experience or go back a page to view the unicorn again.

![readme-eight](images/readme/booking-page.png)

If a user clicks 'Book this experience!' they get the following page which shows the experience car once more, shows the booking availabily and a calendar with selectable date functionality. A date can be selected from the calendar and if the 'BOOK NOW' button is clicked the following page can be viewed.
