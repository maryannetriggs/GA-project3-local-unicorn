# GA Project 3 - Local Unicorn

Local Unicorn is a travel website to help travellers find unique tours provided by local guides (unicorns). Users can either register as a traveller and book tours or as a unicorn and provide tours. This was the third project I completed during the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive (bootcamp) course.
